This project takes standard input from the user and prints each string in reverse order vertically, essentially rotating the text 90 degrees.

The program can be built by simply calling make in the command line. Input text can be read by the program with the following command line:

printf "enter\ntext\nhere" | ./rot90

A new column is printed every time the program encounters '\n'.
